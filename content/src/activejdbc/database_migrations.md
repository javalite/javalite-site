   <h1>Database migrations</h1>
</div>


Database migrations is a process of making changes to database schema during a development process.
See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schema_migration">Schema_migration</a> to understand better what database migrations are.

## DB-Migrator is Maven plugin

Current implementation of this project is a Maven Plugin.
Future releases might include a standalone library for non-Maven projects.

## Supported languages

Starting with version 2.3.3-j8-SNAPSHOT for Java8 and 3.0-SNAPSHOT for Java 11 and above, migrations can be written in:

* SQL 
* Groovy


See the next section  for instructions  on creationg new migration files.  

## Writing a new migration

Generate a new  SQL migration file: 

~~~~ {.prettyprint}
mvn db-migrator:new -Dname=create_people_table
~~~~

This command will result in:

~~~~ {.prettyprint}
...
[INFO] Created new migration: src/migrations/20140211113507_create_people_table.sql
...
~~~~

The newly created file is empty. Go ahead and add raw SQL to the file

~~~~ {.prettyprint}
create table people ( name varchar (10));
~~~~


To generate a new  Groovy  migration file: 

~~~~ {.prettyprint}
mvn db-migrator:new -Dname=move_data_from_one_table_to_another.groovy
~~~~


> If you specify the file extension `.groovy`, you will have a Groovy file generated. The migrator will automatically
open a connection to the right database before executing the groovy file, and close it after

The artifact `org.javalite.javalite-common` as  well as `org.javalite.activejdbc` will be on the classpath of your script,
so you can use `Base` and other classes as you wish.  

Run migrations:

~~~~ {.prettyprint}
mvn db-migrator:migrate
...
[INFO] Migrating jdbc:mysql://localhost/test_project using migrations at src/migrations/
[INFO] Migrating database, applying 1 migration(s)
[INFO] Running migration 20140211113507_create_people_table.sql
~~~~

> Alternatively, you can just run the build.

## Custom delimiter (SQL only)


By default, the migrator uses semicolon to separate statements in a file from one another.   
However, in some cases you need to write a complicated query, which will be hard to parse. 
Examples might be sequences, stored procedures, inserts   with semicolons in content, etc. 
For cases like that you can define a custom delimiter with a keyword `DELIMITER`:


~~~~ {.prettyprint .sql .numberLines}
CREATE TABLE course_profiles (
  id           INT(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  course_id    INT(11),
  title        VARCHAR(128),
  subject      VARCHAR(128),
  description  TEXT,
  language     VARCHAR(16),
  created_at   DATETIME DEFAULT NULL,
  updated_at   DATETIME DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (id),
  INDEX course_language (course_id, language)
)
  ENGINE=InnoDB
  DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8;

DELIMITER $$

CREATE PROCEDURE migrate_courses_details()
  BEGIN
    DECLARE done INT DEFAULT FALSE;
    DECLARE cId INT(11);
    DECLARE cTitle VARCHAR(128);
    DECLARE cSubject VARCHAR(128);
    DECLARE cDesc TEXT;
    DECLARE createdAt DATETIME;
    DECLARE updatedAt DATETIME;
    DECLARE courseCursor CURSOR FOR  select id, title, subject, description, created_at, updated_at from courses;
    DECLARE CONTINUE HANDLER FOR NOT FOUND SET done = TRUE;

    OPEN courseCursor;

    courses_loop: LOOP
      FETCH courseCursor INTO  cId, cTitle, cSubject, cDesc, createdAt, updatedAt;
      IF done THEN
        LEAVE courses_loop;
      END IF;
      INSERT INTO course_profiles
      SET
        course_id = cId,
        title = cTitle,
        subject = cSubject,
        description = cDesc,
        language = 'en-US',
        created_at = createdAt,
        updated_at = updatedAt;

    END LOOP;
    CLOSE courseCursor;
  END $$
DELIMITER ;

CALL migrate_courses_details();

DROP PROCEDURE migrate_courses_details;

ALTER TABLE courses DROP COLUMN title;
ALTER TABLE courses DROP COLUMN subject;
ALTER TABLE courses DROP COLUMN description;
~~~~

Note on line 16  `DELIMITER $$` defining the delimiter as `$$`. The Migrator will use `$$` as delimiter until it is redefined again, 
which happens  on line 50.  


## All goals

You can execute plugin help goal to get all information on all other goals:

~~~~ {.prettyprint}
mvn  db-migrator:help
...

## Where to get

Generally, just add a plugin configuration to your pom, as described below. If you want to download, you can
do so here: <a href="http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Ca%3A%22db-migrator-maven-plugin%22">db-migrator-maven-plugin</a>


## Property file configuration

> Using a property file for connection configuration is a preferred way of configuring JavaLite DB-Migrator.

If you have only one database, it does not make much difference which method of configuration you use.
However if you have a test and development databases locally (recommended), then you also have staging and
production environments, we certainly recommend using property file configuration over Maven profiles.


Here is a simple plugin element for the plugin:

~~~~{.xml .numberLines}
<properties>
    <activejdbc.version>2.2</activejdbc.version>
    <environments>development.test,development</environments>
</properties>
<build>
    <plugin>
        <groupId>org.javalite</groupId>
        <artifactId>db-migrator-maven-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>${activejdbc.version}</version>
        <configuration>
            <configFile>${project.basedir}/src/main/resources/database.properties</configFile>
            <environments>${environments}</environments>
        </configuration>
        <executions>
            <execution>
                <id>dev_migrations</id>
                <phase>validate</phase>
                <goals>
                    <goal>migrate</goal>
                </goals>
            </execution>
        </executions>
        <dependencies>
            <dependency>
                <groupId>mysql</groupId>
                <artifactId>mysql-connector-java</artifactId>
                <version>5.1.34</version>
            </dependency>
        </dependencies>
    </plugin>
</build>
~~~~

As you can see, the configuration is really located in file `${project.basedir}/src/main/resources/database.properties`.
The contents of this file might look lile this:

~~~~{.numberLines}
development.driver=com.mysql.jdbc.Driver
development.username=dev1
development.password=passwd
development.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost/project1_development

development.test.driver=com.mysql.jdbc.Driver
development.test.username=dev1
development.test.password=passwd
development.test.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost/project1_test

jenkins.test.driver=com.mysql.jdbc.Driver
jenkins.test.username=jenkins
jenkins.test.password=passwd
jenkins.test.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost/project1_testenv

staging.driver=com.mysql.jdbc.Driver
staging.username=stage1
staging.password=passwd
staging.url=jdbc:mysql://192.168.80.40/project1_staging

production.driver=com.mysql.jdbc.Driver
production.username=prod1
production.password=passwd
production.url=jdbc:mysql://192.168.20.40/project1_production

~~~~

In the file above, the blocks of properties with a specific prefix belong to a corresponding environment.
For example, there are 5 environments defined on this file:

* development
* testenv
* staging
* production

### Executing for environment

Executing DB-Migrator is described above in section [All goals](#all-goals).
The plugin will run migrations for environments `test` and `development` because they are configured in the
`<properties>` section (see above). In order to override this behavior, you need to override the `<environments>`
property from a command line like this:

~~~~
mvn db-migrator:migrate -Denvironments=staging
~~~~

The command above will run the goal `migrate` with a set of properties to point to staging environment.
It makes it easy to point the plugin to different databases and write simple scripts for migrations.

If you want to execute for multiple environments (typical example, is to migrate all local databases), simply 
 list environments as a comma separated list:

~~~~
mvn db-migrator:migrate -Denvironments=development.test,development
~~~~


### Property file location

In the example above, the file is located in project sources: `${project.basedir}/src/main/resources/database.properties`.
This means that it will probably be pushed to your source repository with credentials.
In some projects this is acceptable, while in others it is not. However, location of this file is irrelevant to the
plugin, so a development team can decide whether they want to commit it to a repository, or keep locally private.


## Maven configuration

Maven configuration is more complicated, and not recommended.
Please, see property file-based configuration above.

Here is an example of simple configuration:

~~~~ {.xml  .numberLines}
<plugin>
    <groupId>org.javalite</groupId>
    <artifactId>db-migrator-maven-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>2.2</version>
    <configuration>
        <driver>com.mysql.jdbc.Driver</driver>
        <url>jdbc:mysql://localhost/test_project</url>
        <username>your user</username>
        <password>your password</password>
    </configuration>
    <dependencies>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>mysql</groupId>
            <artifactId>mysql-connector-java</artifactId>
            <version>5.1.25</version>
        </dependency>
    </dependencies>
</plugin>
~~~~

In a more realistic project, you will have more than one database, such as test, development, production, etc.
In order to migrate multiple databases, use Maven executions:

First, configure the plugin in `pluginManagement`:

~~~~ {.xml  .numberLines}
<pluginManagement>
    <plugins>
        <plugin>
            <groupId>org.javalite</groupId>
            <artifactId>db-migrator-maven-plugin</artifactId>
            <version>2.2</version>
            <configuration>
                <username>${jdbc.user}</username>
                <password>${jdbc.password}</password>
                <driver>${jdbc.driver}</driver>
            </configuration>
            <dependencies>
                <dependency>
                    <groupId>mysql</groupId>
                    <artifactId>mysql-connector-java</artifactId>
                    <version>5.1.25</version>
                </dependency>
            </dependencies>
        </plugin>
    </plugins>
</pluginManagement>
~~~~

where user, password and driver are configured as project properties.

 After that, you can configure the plugin to execute multiple databases by adding many executions.
 Here is example of one execution:

~~~~ {.xml  .numberLines}
<plugin>
    <groupId>org.javalite</groupId>
    <artifactId>db-migrator-maven-plugin</artifactId>
    <executions>
        <execution>
            <id>dev_migrations</id>
            <phase>validate</phase>
            <goals>
                <goal>migrate</goal>
            </goals>
        </execution>
        <execution>
            <id>test_migrations</id>
            <phase>validate</phase>
            <goals>
                <goal>migrate</goal>
            </goals>
            <configuration>
                <url>${jdbc.test.url}</url>
            </configuration>
        </execution>
    </executions>
</plugin>
~~~~

The plugin tied to a validate phase, which will ensure that it will migrate
schema at the very start of the build. Add more executions to run against multiple databases. You can use Maven profiles
with this plugin to migrate databases in different environments, such as production.


### Configuration properties

* `url` - JDBC connection URL
* `driver` - JDBC connection driver
* `username` - JDBC connection user name
* `password` - JDBC connection password
* `migrationsPath` - location of migration files, defaults to  `src/migrations/`
* `createSql` - create database SQL, defaults to `create database {$your database}`
* `dropSql` - drop database SQL, defaults to `drop database {$your database}`


### Maintaining multiple databases

You can use Maven profiles to maintain multiple database, as well as specific configuration for different executions
of the same plugin.

## Migration records

DB-Migrator maintains a record of executing migrations in table `SCHEMA_VERSION` and will not execute the same migration twice:

~~~~ {.prettyprint}
mysql> select * from schema_version;
~~~~

Results in the following output:

 version         applied_on          duration 
 --------------- ------------------  -----------
 20140302193112  2014-07-03 22:08:41 22

## Development process


Since all migrations are recorded as text (SQL) files, and contain a time stamp in the name, every time a developer pulls
sources from source repository and executes a build, your database is migrated to the latest migration automatically.
In our experience, this reduced amount of attention we had to give a DB to a minimum. Basically a developer creates a
new migration and checks it in, which makes it propagate to other developer machines automatically.

### Step 1: Create migration file

At the root of your project execute: 

~~~~
mvn db-migrator:new -Dname=create_people_table
~~~~
This will simply create a new empty text file: 

~~~~
Created new migration: .../src/migrations/20160130213201_create_people_table.sql
~~~~

where 20160130213201 is a timestamp that is a good indicator when this migration was created. 

### Step 2: Write SQL:

Open this file with your favorite text editor and add free hand SQL there: 

~~~~
CREATE TABLE people (
  id  int(11) DEFAULT NULL auto_increment PRIMARY KEY,
  first_name VARCHAR(128),
  last_name  VARCHAR(128),
  created_at DATETIME,
  updated_at DATETIME
)ENGINE=InnoDB;
~~~~

### Step 3: Run migration:

Execute this command and observe output: 

~~~~
$mvn db-migrator:migrate
[INFO] Scanning for projects...
[INFO]                                                                         
[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------

[INFO] Migrated database

~~~~

as you can see from above in this case, two databases were migrated: test and development. The output of the migration command is self-explanatory. 
If you had more migration files defined that have not yet been migrated, they all will be migrated by this step. 

### Step 3 alternative

Since the DB-Migrator is a Maven plugin and is executed during a normal build, every time you run a project build with:

~~~~
mvn clean install
~~~~

your new migrations will be executed against target databases. This means you do not need to execute 
`mvn db-migrator:migrate` during a normal development process.
