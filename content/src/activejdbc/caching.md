   <h1>Caching</h1>
</div>


Caching is an integral part of every major system, It improves performance, reduces IO and makes overall user
experience more pleasurable. Caching in ActiveJDBC works on the level of query and creation of model instances.
For instance, the call:

~~~~ {.java  .numberLines}
List<Library> illLibs = Library.where("state = ?", "IL");
~~~~

might call into DB, or a result can come from cache, depending how cache and specifically model `Library` was configured

## Cache annotation

ActiveJDBC provides annotation to specify queries against which tables will be cached:

~~~~ {.java  .numberLines}
@Cached
public class Library extends Model {}
~~~~

As in other cases, this is a declaration that marks a model as "cachable". If you enable logging (by providing a system property `activejdbc.log`), you will see extensive output from ActiveJDBC, similar to this:

~~~~ {.java  .numberLines}
3076 [main] INFO org.javalite.activejdbc.DB - Query: "SELECT * FROM libraries WHERE id = ?", with parameters: [1], took: 0 milliseconds
3076 [main] INFO org.javalite.activejdbc.cache.QueryCache - HIT, "SELECT * FROM libraries WHERE id = ?", with parameters: [1]
3077 [main] INFO org.javalite.activejdbc.DB - Query: "INSERT INTO libraries (address, state, city) VALUES (?, ?, ?)", with parameters: [123 Pirate Street, CA, Bloomington], took: 1 milliseconds
3077 [main] INFO org.javalite.activejdbc.cache.QueryCache - table cache purged for: libraries
3077 [main] INFO org.javalite.activejdbc.cache.QueryCache - table cache purged for: books
3077 [main] INFO org.javalite.activejdbc.cache.QueryCache - MISS, "SELECT * FROM libraries WHERE id = ?", with parameters: [1]
3078 [main] INFO org.javalite.activejdbc.DB - Query: "SELECT * FROM libraries WHERE id = ?", with parameters: [1], took: 0 milliseconds
~~~~

## Cache Configuration

The cache configuration includes providing a cache manager class name in the file `activejdbc.properties`.
This file will have to be on the root of classpath. Here is one example:

~~~~ {.prettyprint}
#inside file: activejdbc.properties
#or EHCache:
cache.manager=org.javalite.activejdbc.cache.EHCacheManager
#cache.manager=org.javalite.activejdbc.cache.OSCacheManager
~~~~

Here two things happen: 1. Cache in general is enabled (it is not enabled even if you have @Cached annotations on classes),
and 2. ActiveJDBC will be using EHCacheManager as an implementation of cache.

## Automatic cache purging

If you examine the log from above, you will see that after an insert statement into the "LIBRARIES" table,
the system is purging cache related to this table, as well as "BOOKS" table. ActiveJDBC does this since the cache in
memory might be potentially of out sync with the data in the DB, and hence will be purged. Related tables' caches are
also purged. Since there exists relationship: library has many books, the books cache could also be stale, and this is
a reason why a table "BOOKS" purged as well.

## Manual cache purging


If you want to manually purge caches (in cases you make mutative or destructive data operations outside Model API), you can do so:

~~~~ {.java  .numberLines}
org.javalite.activejdbc.cache.QueryCache.instance().purgeTableCache("books");
~~~~

or:

~~~~ {.java  .numberLines}
Books.purgeCache();
~~~~

## Purge all caches

If you want  to purge all caches, here is a snippet: 

```java
QueryCache.instance().getCacheManager().flush(CacheEvent.ALL);
```

## Listen/Propagate cache events

In more complex  applications you may want to listen to cache events and then act on them: lets say  propagate 
cache purging across cluster. 

First, you need to create a listener for the cache events: 

```java 
public class AppCacheEventListener implements CacheEventListener{
   public void void onFlush(CacheEvent event){
       // implementation goes here
   }
}
```
Then, register the listener: 

```java
Registry.cacheManager().addCacheEventListener(new AppCacheEventListener());
```

Once this is done, the listener will start getting notified if a cache for a specific table is getting purged.  


## What to cache

While caching is a complex issue, I can suggest caching predominantly lookup data. Lookup data is something that does
not change very frequently. If you start caching everything, you might run into a problem of cache thrashing where you
fill cache with data, and purge it soon after, without having a benefit of caching. Instead of improving performance,
you will degrade it with extra CPU, RAM and IO (is cluster is configured) used and little or no benefit of having a
cache in the first place.

## Things to be careful about

### Potential for memory leaks

ActiveJDBC caches results from queries on object level. For instance, lets consider this code: 

~~~~ {.java .numberLines}

@Cached
public class Student(){}

...

List<Student> students = professor.getAll(Student.class); 

~~~~
Essentially the framework generates a query like this: 

~~~~ {.sql .numberLines}
SELECT * FROM students WHERE professor_id = ?;
~~~~

and sets a parameter `professor_id` to prepared statement. Since the model `Student` is `@Cached`, 
then entire `List<Student> students` list will be cached. 

>The key to the list as a cached object is a combination of 
 query text as well as all parameters to the query. 


As a result, these two queries:

~~~~ {.sql .numberLines}
SELECT * FROM students WHERE professor_id = 1;
SELECT * FROM students WHERE professor_id = 2;
~~~~

will produce two independent lists in cache just because their parameters are different. 
So, what will happen if you run many thousands or millions of queries that are the same, but only differ 
in parameters? You guess it, you will end up with millions of useless objects in cache and eventually will 
get an [OutOfMemoryError](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/OutOfMemoryError.html). 

The solution is to examine code, and ensure you are caching objects that are actually reusable. 

It is possible to access and manage cache directly instead of `@Cached` annotation: 

~~~~ {.java .numberLines}

import org.javalite.activejdbc.Registry;

CacheManager manager = Registry.cacheManager();
manager.addCache(group, key, object); 

///then later in code: 

List<Students> students = (List<Students>)manager.getCache(group, key);
~~~~

This way, you have a fine-tuned ability to only store specific objects in cache.  

### Cached data is exposed directly 

When retrieving instances of cached models, be aware that exactly the same instances can be returned by subsequent calls to the same query. ActiveJDBC, as a lightweight framework, won't try to be "intelligent" and manage clones of cached data for you. So, for example, considering `Person` is annotated as `@Cached`, two subsequent calls to `Person.findById(1)` will return the same instance:

~~~~ {.java  .numberLines}
Person p1 = Person.findById(1);
System.out.println(p1.get("name")); // prints: John

p1.set("name", "Jane"); // changes the cached data directly
// don't save p1, and ...

Person p2 = Person.findById(1); // ... find the same person again
System.out.println(p2.get("name")); // prints: Jane
~~~~

### Either caching or optimistic locking

Caching and [optimistic_locking](optimistic_locking) don't get along. **Don't use both together.**

Caching guarantees the result of subsequent calls to the same query return the same instances. So there can't be different versions of the same result set living in the memory shared by the cache manager. Suppose `Profile`, a model with [optimistic_locking](optimistic_locking#when-collisions-happen), is also annotated as `@Cached`. The following will happen:

~~~~ {.java  .numberLines}
Profile p1 = Profile.findById(1);
Profile p2 = Profile.findById(1);
// p1 and p2 are actually references to the same instance.

p1.set("profile_type", "hotel");
p1.saveIt();
// record_version of the instance is incremented, then updated in the database.

p2.set("profile_type", "vacation");
p2.saveIt();
// As this is the same instance that had record_version incremented ealier,
// its record_version value will match the database
// and no StaleModelException will be thrown.
~~~~
 
### Relationships

ActiveJDBC manages caches for models and their respective relationships (read above), but in some cases you will use a query that ties together unrelated models:

~~~~ {.java  .numberLines}
List<User> users = User.where("id not in (select user_id from restricted_users)");
~~~~

If there exists a model User that is cached, and model RestrictedUser, and these tables/models have no relationship, then the line above could present a logical problem. 
If you execute the line above, and later change content of RESTRICTED\_USERS table, then the query above will not see the change,
 and will return stale data. Developers need to be aware of this, and deal with these issues carefully. Whenever you change data in 
 RESTRICTED\_USERS table, please purge User model:

~~~~ {.java  .numberLines}
User.purgeCache();
~~~~


### Mutative or destructive operations
 
Whenever you execute a mutative or destructive operation against a model (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE), the entire cache for that model is invalidated. 
 This means that caches are best used for lookup data (duh!). 
 
The framework will also invalidate and drop caches of all related tables. For instance:

Given the tables:

~~~sql
create table USERS (INT id, name VARCHAR);
create table ADDRESSES (INT id, street VARCHAR, city VARCHAR, user_id INT);
~~~
 
 and the models:
 
~~~java
@Cached
public class User extends Model{}

@Cached
public class Address extends Model{}
~~~


If you do this: 

~~~java
user.delete();
~~~

the framework will reset caches for both: User and Address models, not just user. This is done in order to prevent logical errors in the application. 

Constantly changing cached data will then lead to [Cache Stampede](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_stampede). 

### Unrelating models

In some cases, you need  proper foreign keys in tables, but want to disconnect convention-based relationships in code

Given the tables:

~~~sql
create table USERS (INT id, name VARCHAR);
create table ADDRESSES (INT id, street VARCHAR, city VARCHAR, user_id INT);
~~~
 
and the models:
 
~~~java
@Cached
public class User extends Model{}

@Cached UnrelatedTo({User.class})
public class Address extends Model{}
~~~


If you do this: 

~~~java
user.delete();
~~~

the framework will just reset the cache of the User model, and will not touch the cache of the Address model.

## Cache providers

ActiveJDBC has a simple plugin framework for adding cache providers. Currently supports:

-   OSCache is dead now. Although it is working just fine on many of our projects, we recommend using EHCache
-   [EHCache](http://ehcache.org/). EHCache is high performance popular open source project. For documentation, please refer to: [http://ehcache.org/documentation](http://ehcache.org/documentation)
- Redis - based cache provider (recent addition)

## EHCache configuration (v 2.x)

Configuration needs to be provided in a file called `ehcache.xml` found at the root of a classpath. Example of a file content:

~~~~ {.xml  .numberLines}
<ehcache xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
         xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation="http://ehcache.org/ehcache.xsd"
         updateCheck="true" monitoring="autodetect">

    <diskStore path="java.io.tmpdir"/>
    <defaultCache
            maxElementsInMemory="1000"
            eternal="false"
            timeToIdleSeconds="120"
            timeToLiveSeconds="120"
            overflowToDisk="true"
            maxElementsOnDisk="10000"
            diskPersistent="false"
            diskExpiryThreadIntervalSeconds="120"
            memoryStoreEvictionPolicy="LRU"
            />
</ehcache>
~~~~

Please, note that ActiveJDBC does not create named caches in EHCache, but only uses default configuration specified by
`defaultCache` element in this file.

## EHCache configuration (v 3.6.3)

Name of the cache manager class: `org.javalite.activejdbc.cache.EHCache3Manager`. 
Set the following in the file `activejdbc.properties`: 

~~~~
cache.manager=org.javalite.activejdbc.cache.EHCache3Manager
~~~~

In addition,  you will need to configure EHCache itself. For that, add a file called `activejdbc-ehcache.xml`. Here is  simple EHCache v3 configuration: 

~~~~ {.xml .numberLines}
<config xmlns:xsi='http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance' xmlns='http://www.ehcache.org/v3' xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.ehcache.org/v3 ../../../main/resources/ehcache-core.xsd">
    <cache-template name="activejdbc">
        <key-type>java.lang.String</key-type>
        <value-type>java.lang.Object</value-type>
        <heap unit="entries">200</heap>           
    </cache-template>
</config>
~~~~
For more involved configuration options, refer to EHCache v3 documentation. 


## Redis cache configuration

Name of the cache manager class: `org.javalite.activejdbc.cache.RedisCacheManager`.
Set the following in the file `activejdbc.properties`:

~~~~
cache.manager=org.javalite.activejdbc.cache.RedisCacheManager
~~~~

Also, provide a property file called `activejdbc-redis.properties`
with two properties: `redis.cache.manager.host` and `redis.cache.manager.port`
The properties file needs to be at the root of classpath.


> <strong>Limitation:</strong> Redis cache manager does not support `CacheManager#flush(CacheEvent)` with value 'ALL'.


## External cache considerations 

Reset cache when starting a nodes in a cluster - responsibility of a project.
