## Table vs Model name

By convention, all tables use a plural form, while corresponding models use singular form of a word.

Examples are:

* Table `COMPUTERS` is mapped to model `Computer`
* Table `PEOPLE` is mapped to model `Person`
* etc.

> This convention can be overridden with `@Table` annotation.


## English inflections

ActiveJDBC is using English inflections to convert singular form of a model to a plural form of a table.
It does include simple cases such as adding an "s" at the end: `COMPUTERS` => `Computer`, as well
 as English exceptions, such as `PEOPLE` => `Person`, `MICE` => `Mouse`, etc.

> If you are interested in how this is done, and what exceptions are supported, you can inspect source code
of [Inflector](https://github.com/javalite/activejdbc/blob/master/javalite-common/src/main/java/org/javalite/common/Inflector.java)

## Bootstrapping

At the time of first use of a model after an application start, ActiveJDBC fetches metadata from a  connected database
 and looks for tables corresponding to names of models using either English inflections, or values provided by `@Table`
 annotations

Examples:

### Default mapping

~~~~ {.java  .numberLines}
public class Computer extends Model{}
~~~~

will be mapped to a table `COMPUTERS`.


### Default mapping with English exception

~~~~ {.java  .numberLines}
public class Octopus  extends Model{}
~~~~

will be mapped to a table `OCTOPI`.


### Overridden mapping

~~~~ {.java  .numberLines}
@Table("Operator")
public class Operator  extends Model{}
~~~~

will be mapped to a table `OPERATOR`.
