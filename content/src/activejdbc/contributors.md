   <h1>How to contribute</h1>
</div>


JavaLite projects have been around since 2009, powering countless projects. As a typical OSS framework,
it relies on many contributions from the development community.



## Locate and understand source code

Sources are found here: [JavaLite on Github](https://github.com/javalite). Get yourself familiar with general
approaches,architecture, design and tests. many things in JavaLite do not look like typical Java code.

If you have a question, feel free to submit them as Github issues on corresponding projects under JavaLite.
Posting questions to StackOverflow is less desirable because of its limited ability to maintain a conversation
  and opinionated editors.


## Fork a and play with project

This is typical for Github. Now, that you have a clone of the project, play as much as you want.


## Propose a new feature

Create an issue in a corresponding Github project and propose its implementation. Be as detailed as needed
  to convey your new brilliant ideas.

## Implement and submit

Implement a new feature in your fork, and when all tests pass, submit a new Pull Request. The core team will review
 your implementation, potentially provide some feedback and then  will accept a new pull request.

New code will be built into the master and will become available in a current snapshot from our
Snapshot repo: [https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots](https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots).

Once the new code is in the snapshot, it will make it into a new release.

> Any contributed code must come with tests showing that: A: it works,  and B: demonstrating a new feature

## Improve documentation

Documentation (this site) [is on Github too](https://github.com/javalite/javalite-site). The workflow is similar: fork this site, make changes, push your changes, submit a pull request. Easy, right?


## Code of conduct

We are all passionate developers (you including), and working on OSS projects on our free time.
We are also coming from different countries, speak different languages belong to different cultures,
 have different sets of believes and are all different ages. What makes us similar is a burning desire to
 build something better for us and other people.

As such, please follow these simple rules of conduct:

* Do not force your opinion, instead make suggestions
* Do not bash other people's code, no matter how bad you think it is. Instead, suggest an improvement,
or better yet do it yourself.
* Do not call other members any names (what is acceptable in your society, might  sound abrasive in others )
* Generally, be polite and respectful of other members in comments, regardless what opinion you might have
