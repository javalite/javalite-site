   <h1>Activeweb</h1>
   <h4>Full stack web framework</h4>
</div>

Provides everything you need for building a modern dynamic web application or a REST-ful web service.

## Design principles
*  **Convention over configuration** - zero configuration is required to develop ActiveWeb applications, and some conventions are overridable.
*  **Highest degree of developer productivity** - ActiveWeb allows developers to build real Java web projects without the
    need for the typical compile/package/deploy/start cycle. A container is started once, and development can continue.
    ActiveWeb will recompile controllers and reload them into a running container on the fly.
* **Adherence to Java standards** - ActiveWeb binds to core Java standards: JDBC and Servlets.
* **First-rate built-in testing capabilities** - ActiveWeb provides the ability to test every discrete business function,
       including data generated by business logic, the content and structure of generated HTML/JSON/XML/XYZ,
       and complex user scenarios, all without having to start a container. ActiveWeb is perfect for true TDD/BDD, and
       it promotes writing specifications (tests) before coding implementations.
* **Full stack web development platform** - unlike many other Java frameworks,
    which usually solve only one problem, ActiveWeb is a full stack development framework for the Web.
    It provides all features that are integrated together.
* **Integrated dependency injection** - ActiveWeb integrates Google Guice as a dependency injection container.
* **ActiveWeb uses ActiveJDBC as ORM layer** - ActiveWeb uses ActiveJDBC as ORM layer. This is a lightweight integration,
    and both frameworks work very well together. However, developers still have the option of using a different ORM package if desired.
* **Built-in support for Unobtrusive JavaScript** - this allows for the development of dynamic Ajax applications without
    having to write repetitive JavaScript code. Unobtrusive JavaScript does not clutter HTML pages as generated JavaScript would.
