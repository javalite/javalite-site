   <h1>Controllers</h1>
</div>


## Introduction

Controllers are at the heart of an ActiveWeb application. These are classes which designed to process an HTTP request.
Controllers are somewhat similar to Java Servlets, but even more similar to Ruby on Rails, Grails all SpringMVC
controllers. A simplest controller looks like this:

~~~~ {.java  .numberLines}
public class GreetingController extends AppController{
   public void index(){}
}
~~~~

A controller above is a working controller, even though it does not have any code in it. Such a controller is
automatically mapped to a URL:

~~~~ {.prettyprint}
http://host:port/context/greeting
~~~~

## Controller actions

A controller action is a method that is designed to process an HTTP request. For example, in the example above,
the URL will be mapped to the action `index` by default. However, if the URL looked like this:

~~~~ {.prettyprint}
http://host:port/context/greeting/hello
~~~~

then it would map to action `hello`:

~~~~ {.java  .numberLines}
public class GreetingController extends AppController{
   public void hello(){}
}
~~~~

For more on mapping of URLs to controllers and actions please see [Routing](routing).

## Controllers and HTTP methods

The HTTP specification defines methods: GET, POST, DELETE, PUT, CONNECT and HEAD. Currently ActiveWeb supports GET,
POST, DELETE, PUT and HEAD as the most used methods.

An HTTP request is not only mapped to an action, but also its HTTP method must correspond to an action's HTTP method.
Action HTTP methods are configured with annotations, `@GET`, `@POST`, `@PUT`, `@DELETE` and  `@HEAD`.


> If annotation not provided, the action is mapped to HTTP GET method by default

It makes it unnecessary to use annotations except cases when you need so-called "destructive" action.
A destructive action is the one that is designed to change a state of a resource (in REST style of web programming).

Here is an example of a destructive action is:

~~~~ {.java  .numberLines}
public class BooksController extends AppController{

   @PUT
   public void updateBook(){}
}
~~~~

ActiveWeb promotes REST-style web programming and will not allow to access an action that is configured for one
HTTP method with another. For instance, if you try to access the `GreetingController#index` with HTTP method POST,
you would get an exception:

~~~~ {.prettyprint}
activeweb.ControllerException: Cannot access action 
app.controllers.GreetingController.index with HTTP method: 'POST' because it is 
configured for method: 'GET'
~~~~

## RESTful controllers

A restful controller is almost the same as a regular controller. The difference is that in a standard controller you
can define any number of actions and configure them with annotations to accept any HTTP methods. RESTful controllers by
contrast have a set of actions and these actions will accept certain HTTP methods. In order to create a RESTful
controller, you need to do two things:

1.  Add `@RESTful` annotation to the controller class
2.  Provide a fixed set of action methods in the body of controller

Here is an example of a RESTful controller taken from Kitchensink application:

~~~~ {.java  .numberLines}
@RESTful
public class RpostsController extends AppController {
    public void index(){...}
    public void newForm(){...}
    public void create(){...}
    public void show(){...}
    public void destroy(){...}
~~~~

See the [Kitchensink](https://github.com/javalite/javalite-examples/tree/master/kitchensink) code, as well as more on restful controllers in the [Routing](routing) page.

A RESTful controller is allowed to have 7 methods, and they all are automatically mapped to the following URSs and HTTP methods:


verb        path                   action           used for                                     
------      --------------------   ------------     ------------------------------------------------
 GET         /books                 index           display a list of all books                  
 GET         /books/new_form        new_form        return an HTML form for creating a new book  
 POST        /books                 create          create a new book                            
 GET         /books/id              show            display a specific book                      
 GET         /books/id/edit_form    edit_form       return an HTML form for editing a books      
 PUT         /books/id              update          update a specific book                       
 DELETE      /books/id              destroy         delete a specific book                       



There is no need to add any other annotations to RESTful controllers.

If you examine the table above, you will see that a combination of a path and HTTP method is mapped to an action.
For instance, a path '/books' is mapped twice, with GET HTTP method to action `index`, an with POST to action `create`.
This makes for elegant, REST-style URLs and leads ultimately to better user experience.

## Location of controllers in project

The page [Structure of a web project](structure_of_activeweb_project) states that controllers are located in a package:

~~~~ {.java  .numberLines}
app.controllers
~~~~

ActiveWeb specifies that all controllers are located in this package or sub-packages.

## Controller names

A controller name is a name of the controller that can be deduced from the controller class name.  


> Controller name is an undescroder lower case controller class name  without the "Controller" part.

For instance, if you have a controller class `TimeServerController`, then the controller name will be `time_server`.




## Controller paths

A controller path is made of a sub-package and a controller name. A controller name is *not* a class name, but rather
underscored, flattened name part of a class' simple name.

Example 1:

~~~~ {.java  .numberLines}
package app.controllers;
class BooksController{..} // ===> controller path: /books
~~~~

Example 2:

~~~~ {.java  .numberLines}
package app.controllers;
class UniversityBooksController{..} // ===> controller path: /university_books
~~~~

Example 3:

~~~~ {.java  .numberLines}
package app.controllers.depaul;
class UniversityBooksController{..} // ===> controller path: /depaul/university_books
~~~~

Example 4:

~~~~ {.prettyprint}
package app.controllers.depaul.chicago;
class UniversityBooksController{..} // ===> controller path: /depaul/chicago/university_books
~~~~

> For more information on mapping requests to controllers, refer to [Routing](/routing).


## V in MVC

ActiveWeb does not use JSPs. Instead it uses [FreeMarker](http://freemarker.sourceforge.net/) (FM). The FM templates
are located in this directory:

~~~~ {.prettyprint}
src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/views
~~~~

## Mapping to views

The directory: `src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/views` has subdirectories. These subdirectories are named after controller paths.
This makes it easy to find FM templates (views) associated with controllers.

### Default mapping to views

Under normal circumstances, the HTTP request is applied to an action, and then the framework passes control to a view.
Under these conditions, there is no need for any configuration or code.

Example: if a HTTP GET request is sent to this URL: `http://hostname/context/greeting`, then the framework will
invoke a `GreetingControoller`, and by default action `index`:

~~~~ {.java  .numberLines}
public class GreetingController extends AppController{
   public void index(){}
}
~~~~

After execution of an action, the framework will find a template:

~~~~ {.prettyprint}
src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/views/greeting/index.ftl
~~~~

will render it, and send results to the browser.

ActiveWeb, in the same spirit as [ActiveJDBC](activejdbc) does not have any configuration files. Most actions are based
on conventions.

### Override mapping to relative views

In some cases, you need to override default mapping to views. You will use a `render()` method for this:

~~~~ {.java  .numberLines}
public class GreetingController extends AppController{
   public void index(){
      //some code here
      render("show");
   }
}
~~~~

The `render("show");` will signal to ActiveWeb that instead of view `index`, you want to render a view `show`.
Since you did not provide any other information, ActiveWeb will assume that this view will be found at the same location:

~~~~ {.prettyprint}
src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/views/greeting/show.ftl
~~~~

### Override mapping to absolute views

Sometimes you need to call a view that "belongs" to a different controller, or even some shared view. In that case,
you can specify an "absolute" path to a view like this:

~~~~ {.java  .numberLines}
public class GreetingController extends AppController{
   public void index(){
      //some code here
      render("/shared/show");
   }
}
~~~~

ActiveWeb will use the following view to render:

~~~~ {.prettyprint}
src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/views/shared/show.ftl
~~~~

### Passing data to views

Passing data to views is done with two methods:

-   assign(name, value)
-   view(name, value)

There is no difference between these methods, they are aliases. Use whichever you like.

Example:

~~~~ {.java  .numberLines}
public class GreetingController extends AppController{
   public void index(){
       view("name", "John Doe");
   }
}
~~~~

The corresponding view can look like this:

~~~~ {.prettyprint}
Hello, my name is: ${name}
~~~~

You could have guessed that the output will look like:

~~~~ {.prettyprint}
Hello, my name is: John Doe
~~~~



## Ajax APIs


### detecting if a request is Ajax

Controllers (and filters alike) provide a simple way to detect if a request is a from an
[XmlHttpRequest](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XMLHttpRequest) in browser:

~~~~ {.java  .numberLines}
public class GreetingController extends AppController{
   public void index(){
      if(xhr()){
         ...
      }else{
         ...
      }
   }
}
~~~~

The `xhr();` method also has an alias: `isXhr();`.

### Responding to Ajax call directly

ActiveWeb provides a simple method `respond(..)`:

~~~~ {.java  .numberLines}
public class GreetingController extends AppController{
   public void index(){
      respond("<message>hello</message>").contentType("text/xml").status(200);
   }
}
~~~~

It is easy to use this method to send plain text, XML, JSON, or any other text format as a response to Ajax call.

### Responding to Ajax call with a view

Method `respond()` is usually used to respond with quick HTML snippet, or generated JSON or other format. However,
if you need to respond with a more complex structure, and potentially generate it with a view and use a full
power of a view expression language for condition, iteration, etc, you can use a regular `render()` method, the one
that is also used for rendering HTML pages. However, for Ajax calls layouts are not necessary, so the call will
look like this:

~~~~ {.java  .numberLines}
public class AjaxController extends AppController{
   public void index(){
      //some code here
      render().noLayout();
   }
}
~~~~

> The actual response could be plain text, a snippet of HTML, JavaScript, etc. This is a great method to build web services.

The URL for this call will look like this: `http://host/context/ajax`. The Ajax actions act just like any other actions,
they support all HTTP methods and annotations.


## Other responses

Sometimes, it's better to parse a template, and get the result as a string for further processing. For example, when sending emails, so you can write the email body in a template, feed the template with the required parameter map, and let the template engine do the hard work for you. That can be achieved with the `merge()` method from any Controller or Filter:

~~~~ {.java  .numberLines}
public class EmailController extends AppController{
   @POST
   public void send(){
      //... get and validate the parameters in a model instance
      String from = model.getString("user_email");
      String to   = appContext().get("sender_email_address");
      
      String body = merge("/shared/emails/welcome", model.toMap());
      
      MyMailHelper.sendEmail(from, to, body);   // some helper function, wrapping for ex. commons.email
      //... continue
   }
}
~~~~

## Downloading of files

There are a few calls you can use for file download:

-   sending files to a client:

~~~~ {.java  .numberLines}
public class GetPdfController extends AppController{
   public void index(){   
     File f;
      //... obtain file
     sendFile(f).contentType("application/pdf").status(200);
   }
}
~~~~

-   Streaming bytes to a client:

~~~~ {.java  .numberLines}
public class GetPdfController extends AppController{
   public void index(){   
     byte[] bytes;
      //... obtain data
     outputStream("application/pdf").write(bytes);
   }
}
~~~~

-   Reading from InputStream and sending to client:

~~~~ {.java  .numberLines}
public class GetPdfController extends AppController{
   public void index(){   
     InputStream in;
      //... point input stream to data
     streamOut(in).contentType("application/pdf");
   }
}
~~~~

-   Steaming a file to a client with a file name

~~~~ {.java  .numberLines}
public class GetCsvController extends AppController{
   public void index(){
     OutputStream out = outputStream("text/csv", map("Content-Disposition", "attachment;filename=metadata_" + param("type") + ".csv"), 200);
     out.write(...); // write content of file here
     // no need to close the stream, container will do that
   }
}
~~~~

## Uploading files

Controllers have a two ways for uploading data. Here is one:

~~~~ {.java  .numberLines}
public class UploadController extends AppController{

   @POST
   public void index(){
        Iterator<FormItem> iterator = uploadedFiles();
        if (iterator.hasNext()){
            FormItem item = iterator.next();
            String name = item.getFileName();
            if(item.isFile()){
                InputStream in = item.getInputStream();
                ///process data
            }               
        }
}
~~~~

.. and here is another:

~~~~ {.java  .numberLines}
public class UploadsController extends AppController {
    @POST
    public void index(){
        List<FormItem> items = multipartFormItems();
        //process items
    }
}
~~~~

The second method is preferred for large files, because they are streamed to hard drive.

## Session management

A session object is accessed with a `session()` call inside controllers:

~~~~ {.java  .numberLines}
public class HomeController extends AppController{
   public void index(){   
     // put a value
     session("name", value);
   }
~~~~

Other methods available on a session object are:

~~~~ {.prettyprint}
  session(name);                    // to get a single value
  session().remove(name);           // remove object by name
  session().names();                // to get a list of all objects in session
  session().getCreationTime();      // obvious
  session().invalidate();           // invalidate session
  session().setTimeToLive(seconds); // set time to live
~~~~

## Cookies management

### Sending cookies to a client

~~~~ {.java  .numberLines}
sendCookie(Cookie);               //sends a cookie to client
sendCookie(name, value);          //simple short cut to do the same as above 
sendPermanentCookie(name, value); //will send a cookie with time to live == 20 years
~~~~

### Getting cookies from request

~~~~ {.java  .numberLines}
List<Cookie> cookies(); //gets a list of all cookies sent in request
Cookie cookie(name);    //retrieve an individual cookie
cookieValue(name);      //retrieve a cookie value by name of cookie
~~~~

## Logging

Controllers already have a way to log information to a log system. These methods are available for logging:

~~~~ {.prettyprint}
logDebug(..);
logWarning(..);
logError(..);
logInfo(..);
~~~~

## Threading issues

Controllers are thread safe. An instance of a controller is created to process each and every request, and then discarded.
This means that if you create instance variables in controller, this variable will not interfere with another value
form another request.

However, creation of instance variables in controller classes is considered a bad coding practice in general, because
it is vulnerable to side effects. While controllers are objects in OO language (Java), they need to be treated as
procedural devices when it comes to processing HTTP requests. This means that every action should be completely
self-sufficient and not rely on some instance variable set by another action or that a method invoked from an action
should not depend on an instance variable set higher up the stack.
