   <h1>Routing</h1>
</div>

Routing in ActiveWeb is an act of matching an incoming request URL to a controller and action. Current implementation
supports: 

* Standard routing 
* REST - based routing 
* Custom routing

## Definition of terms

There are some routing terms defined in ActiveWeb:
 
* **Controller name** - logical name of controller as it relates to the URI mapping. a controller name is an underscored or hyphenated short class name. For instance, if the class name is `app.controllers.api.v2.AuthorsController` then the controller name  is `authors_controller`. It will be the same for a class `app.controllers.AuthorsController`.
* **Controller class** - Java class name of controller
* **Action** - action is part of URL mapped to a method of a controller.
* **Action method** - method of controller mapped to an action. Every public method of a controller is theoretically an action. 
* **ID** - id sometimes present on the URL, such as: `/books/show/id`. 

Example, for URI: `/books/show/123`:
 
* Controller name is: "books"
* Controller class name:  `app.controllers.BooksController`
* Action is: "show"
* Action method is: `app.controllers.BooksController#show()`
* ID is 123
 
## Standard routing

NOTE: the "context" in all URIs is a web application context, which is usually a WAR file name.


path                       controller                          action    id 
-------------------        -------------------------------     -------   -------
/books                     app.controllers.BooksController     index           
/books/save                app.controllers.BooksController     save            
/books/save/123            app.controllers.BooksController     save        123 


In standard routing, the HTTP method is not considered, but you might get an exception of you send an HTTP method to an 
action that is configured for a different HTTP method. Routing and action HTTP methods are independent in case of 
standard routing. For standard routing, there is no need to do anything, it works by default

> If action is missing, it is assumed to be `index` by default


## RESTful routing

In case of restful routing, the actions are pre-configured. RESTful routing is configured by placing a @RESTfull annotation on a controller.
For more informaiton, see: [RESTful controllers](controllers#restful-controllers)

HTTP method       path                  controller                        action      used for
-------------     --------------------  --------------------------------  ---------   ------------------------------------------------------
GET               /books                app.controllers.BooksController   index       display a list of all books                
GET               /books/new\_form      app.controllers.BooksController   new_form    return an HTML form for creating a new book 
POST              /books                app.controllers.BooksController   create      create a new book                          
GET               /books/id             app.controllers.BooksController   show        display a specific book                    
GET               /books/id/edit\_form  app.controllers.BooksController   edit_form   return an HTML form for editing a book
PUT               /books/id             app.controllers.BooksController   update      update a specific book                     
DELETE            /books/id             app.controllers.BooksController   destroy     delete a specific book                     



## Routing with packages

While `app.controllers` is a default package for controllers, you might want to organize them into sub-packages. These sub-packages can only be children of `app.controllers` package though. In case a controller is located in a sub-packages, the path mapping would also include sub-package names:

Standard routing


path                                         controller                                        action          id       
-------------------------                    ----------------------------------------          -------         ----
 /package1/books                              app.controllers.package1.BooksController            index              
 /package1/books/save                         app.controllers.package1.BooksController            save               
 /package1/books/save/123                     app.controllers.package1.BooksController            save         123   
 /package1/package2/books                     app.controllers.package1.package2.BooksController   index              
 /package1/package2/books/save                app.controllers.package1.package2.BooksController   save               
 /package1/package2/books/save/123            app.controllers.package1.package2.BooksController   save         123   



RESTful routing supports sub-packaging exactly the same as standard.

**Please note:** Controller names must not match (sub)package names.

## Mapping paths to controller names

When matching a path to a controller class, ActiveWeb converts a name of a controller from underscore or hyphenated format to CamelCase:


path                     controller                                 
------------------       -------------------------------------------  
/books/index             app.controllers.BooksController                
/student_books           app.controllers.StudentBooksController         
/student-books           app.controllers.StudentBooksController         

  
  
## Mapping actions to action methods


path                  controller#action                                
-----------------     -----------------------------------------------
/books                app.controllers.BooksController#index             
/books/index          app.controllers.BooksController#index            
/books/all_books      app.controllers.BooksController#allBooks           


> ActiveWeb will automatically translate underscored or hyphenated action names to CameCased action method names.
 
 path                      controller#action
 -----------------------   -----------------------------------------
 /books/all_books          app.controllers.BooksController#allBooks
 /books/all-books          app.controllers.BooksController#allBooks


## Custom routing


Besides standard and RESTful, ActiveWeb also offers custom routing. Custom routing provides ability to configure custom URIs to be forwarded to specific controllers and actions.

### Custom routing configuration

As with any other types of configuration, ActiveWeb route configuration is done in code, rather that property or XML files.
Custom routing is done by adding a new class to the application: `app.config.RouteConfig`:

~~~~ {.java  .numberLines}
public class RouteConfig extends AbstractRouteConfig {
    public void init(AppContext appContext) {
        route("/myposts").to(PostsController.class);
        route("/{action}/{controller}/{id}");
        route("/{action}/greeting/{name}").to(HelloController.class);
    }
}
~~~~

Custom routing is based on URI segments, which are chunks of URIs submitted of the request separated by slashes.
For example the following URI has three segments:

~~~~ {.prettyprint}
/greeting/show/bob
~~~~

The above URI has three segments: "greeting", "show", "bob".

ActiveWeb defines three types of segments:

-   Built in
-   Static
-   User (or dynamic)

> I case of a custom routing, the automatic detection of a format  of a template name is not engaged. A developer needs to manually use a `render("index.xml")` method inside a controller (if the URI contains a "format").

### Built-in segments

ActiveWeb defines three built-in segments:

-   `{controller}`
-   `{action}`
-   `{id}`

Using built-in segments, you can reorder where controller, action and Id appear on the URI:

~~~~ {.prettyprint}
/(action)/{controller}/{id}
~~~~

When such a route is specified, this URI:

~~~~ {.prettyprint}
/show/photo/123
~~~~

Will be routed to: `app.controllers.PhotoController#show` with ID ==123.

### Static segments

Static segments are simply plain text without the braces. The are matched one to one with the incoming request. Example:

~~~~ {.java  .numberLines}
route("/{action}/greeting/{name}").to(HelloController.class);
~~~~

In the snippet above, "greeting" is a static segment.

### User/dynamic segments

User segments are any text in braces in configuration which are then converted to parameters that can be retrieved inside controllers and filters. Here is an example:

~~~~ {.java  .numberLines}
route("/{action}/greeting/{name}").to(HelloController.class);
~~~~

where "name" is a placeholder whose value will be available in controller:

URL submitted:

~~~~ {.prettyprint}
/show/greeting/alex
~~~~

will be routed to controller `app.controllers.HelloController#show` and value `name` will be available:

~~~~ {.java  .numberLines}
public class HelloController extends AppController{
  public void show(){
    String name = param("name");
  }
}
~~~~

### Wild card routing

Sometimes you need to route a really long URI to a controller. Here is how:

~~~~ {.java  .numberLines}
route("/blog/*items").to(PostsController.class).action("index");
~~~~

In a case the following URL is submitted:

~~~~ {.prettyprint}
/blog/2014/07/23/how-to-define-activeweb-routes
~~~~

it will be routed to controller `app.controllers.PostsController#index` and value `items` will be available:

~~~~ {.java  .numberLines}
public class PostsController extends AppController{
  public void index(){
    logInfo(param("items")); // will print: 2014/07/23/how-to-define-activeweb-routes
  }
}
~~~~

### Http method - based routing

You can include an Http method used in the request into the routing rule:

~~~~ {.java  .numberLines}
route("/{action}/greeting/{name}").to(HelloController.class).get();
~~~~

In this example, this route will only match the incoming request if the Http method of the request is GET.
There are four corresponding methods: `get()`, `post()`, `put()` and `delete()`.
They can be used in isolation or in combination. For instance, this route:

~~~~ {.java  .numberLines}
route("/{action}/greeting").to(HelloController.class).get().post();
~~~~

will match these requests:

GET:

~~~~ {.prettyprint}
/show/greeting
~~~~

POST:

~~~~ {.prettyprint}
/save/greeting
~~~~

Of course the action `save()` needs to have a @POST annotation for this to work. Annotations are independent of routing rules.

> Default Http method used in routing rules is `get()`.

### Custom routing with packages

It works similarly to standard routing with packages: 

Path: `/api/v2/authors/9` will map to a custom route: `route("/api/v2/{controller}/{aut_id}").to(AuthorsController.class).action("findById");`


### Custom routing with Java code

If all else fails you can develop our own code to match a request to a controller/action: 

route("/{action}/greeting/{name}").to(HelloController.class).get();

```java
route( new RouteBuilder(new RouteBuilderController(), "index"){
    protected boolean matches(String requestUri, ControllerPath controllerPath, HttpMethod httpMethod)  {
        return requestUri.contains("one");// this is a place for custom logic to tell ActiveWeb if this request matches. 
    }
});
```


### RouteConfig reloaded

The class `app.config.RouteConfig` is recompiled and reloaded in development environment in case a system property
`active_reload` is set to true. This makes it easy and fun to play with the routes during development. Please see
[Running in development mode](running_in_development_mode) for more information.


### Strict mode (since v3.0)

Generally, any custom route does not preclude any standard or Restful routes, meaning if you have a custom route to a resource, a standard route to the same or any other resource is still working. That can be turned off like this: 


~~~~ {.java  .numberLines}
public class RouteConfig extends AbstractRouteConfig {
    public void init(AppContext appContext) {
        strictMode();
        route("/myposts").to(PostsController.class);
    }
}
~~~~

If you call the `strictMode()` method in the `RouteConfig` as above, only the routes listed in this class will work. Per example above, only access to `/myposts` will work. Any other request will result in a 404 response.


## Excluding some routes

Exclusion of some routes is necessary for most applications. Static content, such as CSS, HTML, images, etc. should not be
  processed by the framework, but rather should be served by container directly.
  Please, see the "exclusions" section  of the filter configuration in: [RequestDispatcher configuration](structure_of_activeweb_project#requestdispatcher-configuration)
  for more information.

## Ignoring some routes

Exclusions mechanism described above is sometimes too crude. Lets say we want to dynamically compile Less files into CSS
in development environment, but also want the same URL be served directly from container in any environment except development.

Here is an example configuration:

~~~~ {.java  .numberLines}
public class RouteConfig extends AbstractRouteConfig {
    public void init(AppContext appContext) {
        ignore("/bootstrap.css").exceptIn("development");
    }
}
~~~~

In the example above, the web request to this `/bootstrap` URI will result in passing control to a `BootstrapController`
  only in `development` environment. The same request will be completely ignored in any other environment. 
    This means that in non-`development` environment, the server will simply serve `/bootstrap.css` file. 

This is a convenience feature that is commonly used with [Lessc compiler](lessc).
