   <h1>Dependency injection</h1>

Dependency injection is an integral part of a typical Java application. ActiveWeb supports seamless integration
with [Google Guice](http://code.google.com/p/google-guice/).

At the heart of a Google Guice DI, is a concept of a module.

## Creation of a Guice module

Let's say we have a simple interface Greeter:

~~~~ {.java  .numberLines}
public interface Greeter {
    String greet();
}
~~~~

and implementation of this interface:

~~~~ {.java  .numberLines}
public class GreeterImpl implements Greeter{    
    public String greet() {
        return "Hello from real greeter";        
    }
}
~~~~

We can then create a new Guice module:

~~~~ {.java .numberLines}
public class GreeterModule extends AbstractModule {
    protected void configure() {
        bind(Greeter.class).to(GreeterImpl.class).asEagerSingleton();
    }
}
~~~~

In this module, we are binding a `GreeterImpl` to a `Greater` interface as a singleton.
You can call the `bind()` method many times, setting up your object graph.

## Injection of a module into the application

The injection of a Guice module is executed as one line of code inside `AppBootstrap` class, like so:

~~~~ {.java  .numberLines}
public class AppBootstrap extends Bootstrap {

    public void init(AppContext context) {}

    protected Injector getInjector(){
       return Guice.createInjector(new GreeterModule());
    }
}
~~~~

The `Guice.createInjector(..)` takes a varargs, meaning you can inject multiple modules at once.

## Consumption of injected dependencies

Whenever you need a service inside a controller, you will use an `@Inject` annotation provided by Google Guice:

~~~~ {.java  .numberLines}
public class HelloController extends AppController {
 @Inject
 private Greeter greeter;
 public void index(){
     view("message", greeter.greet());
 }
}
~~~~

The `greeter` (line 3) method is set by the framework and injects an instance of a `GreeterImpl` into the `HelloController`
the controller just before it executes an action. Once the controller has a reference to the service, it can consume it (line 5).

Where can you inject dependencies this way? There are three general application components that are injected dependencies:

-   **Controllers**
-   **Controller Filters**
-   **Custom Tags**

The technique is exactly the same, just add @Inject annotation that requires a service from a Guice module, and you can use it in code inside the component

## Mocking and testing

In testing, it is typical to replace real implementation of services with mocks. For an explanation of mocks and stubs,
follow this link [http://martinfowler.com/articles/mocksArentStubs.html](http://martinfowler.com/articles/mocksArentStubs.html).

Why would someone want to use a mock instead of a real implementation? Here are some reasons:

-   Real implementation submits a sensitive transaction (you do not want that during a build!)
-   Real implementation requires a network connection to external resource
-   Real implementation is really... slow.
-   Real implementation does not always cover all conditions in your code at a given time
-   many others

> when you use a real implementation of a service in tests, your test is not only testing your code, but also the
> implementation of a service, mushing everything together.

Now, lets create an mock service (this can also be created using any other mocking libraries, such as [Mockito](https://code.google.com/p/mockito/)):

~~~~ {.java  .numberLines}
public class GreeterMock implements Greeter{
    public String greet() {
        return "Hello from " + this.getClass().toString();  
    }
}
~~~~

and a new mock module we will use in tests:

~~~~ {.java  .numberLines}
public class GreeterMockModule extends AbstractModule {
    @Override
    protected void configure() {
        bind(Greeter.class).to(GreeterMock.class).asEagerSingleton();
    }
}
~~~~

Once we have this done, we can inject the mock module during the test of a controller:

~~~~ {.java  .numberLines}
 public class HelloControllerSpec extends ControllerSpec {
     @Before
     public void before(){
         setInjector(Guice.createInjector(new GreeterMockModule()));
     }
     @Test
     public void shouldInjectMockService(){
         request().get("index");
         a(val("message")).shouldBeEqual("Hello from class app.services.GreeterMock");
     }
 }
~~~~

Lets examine this test line by line:

-   Line 4 - this is where we tell the test scaffolding which module to use, and we chose a mock module
-   Line 8 - we construct a GET request for HelloController, action "index" and execute the controller.
-   Line 9 - we inspect that the controller did in fact send a `message` to a view, but the value of this message
will be generated by the mock service.

Please, refer to [Kitchensink](https://github.com/javalite/kitchensink) for a working example of DI in ActiveWeb.


## Easier Mocking
 
While [Google Guice](http://code.google.com/p/google-guice/) provides a way of mocking by creating a new mock module, 
it feels heavy-handed. ActiveWeb specs provide a more elegant API for mocking: 


~~~~ {.java  .numberLines}
@Test
public void shouldOverrideWithMock(){
    setInjector(createInjector(new GreeterModule()).override(Greeter.class).with(GreeterMock.class).create());
    request().get("index");
    a(responseContent()).shouldBeEqual("The greeting is: Hello from mock greeter");
}
~~~~

You can chain the `override(..).with(..)` for multiple services in the container. 
Internally ActiveWeb simply creates dynamic modules on the fly. 

Here, the `GreeterMock.class` will replace the real implementation of `Greeter.class` provided in the module 
(supposedly `GreeterImpl.class`). 

## Easier Yet Mocking

In some cases you will not want to create a new module class for one or two services. There is an easier way 
to set your service interfaces and implementations without a new module. 

Here is one example: 
  
~~~~ {.java  .numberLines}
public void before(){
    Injector i = injector().bind(Greeter.class).to(GreeterMock.class)
                           .bind(Redirector.class).to(RedirectorImpl.class).create();
}
~~~~

The framework will create a dynamic module, bind interfaces and implementations and use it to create a new Injector 
 on the fly. 
 
Sometimes, you will only have a single service class not broken into an interface and implementation.
  In such a case, the `to()` method is optional: 
  
~~~~ {.java  .numberLines}
public void before(){
        injector().bind(EmailService.class).create();
}
~~~~
  
> The instance of a new injector will be added to the current context and will be used to inject
services into filters and controllers executing this test. 


## Easier Yet Mocking with provided instances

In some cases, you still want to be in control of creating an  instance of a service to be injected. It could be a more complex class, a Mockito-generated mock, or anything else you need. 
You will then be able to use the `toInstance()` method to add an instance. 
Here is a snippet from the JavaLite sources: 


```java
    public void shouldOverrideWithMockitoInstance(){

        Greeter mock = Mockito.mock(Greeter.class);
        when(mock.greet()).thenReturn("hello there!!!");

        injector().bind(Greeter.class).toInstance(mock).create();

        request().get("index");
        a(responseContent()).shouldBeEqual("The greeting is: hello there!!!");
    }

```

The line that  starts with `injector()` uses the `toInstance(..)` method, which allows you to bind a pre-initialized instance to an interface passed to the `bind(..)` method. 

**_Do not forget to call a 'terminal' method `create()`_**
